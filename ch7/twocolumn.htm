The Puntarenas tourist area and the Golfo Islands comprise 1517 sq. miles and 264 miles of coast line. Part of the area’s boundaries is undefined since a part of the Nicoya Peninsula, as well as the city of Puntarenas, fall within this area. The shoreline of both tourism areas is joined by maritime transport. The area extends from Punta Conejo south to Puerto caldera where the mouth of the Bongo River is located.

Puntarenas is one of the most important tourism regions in Costa Rica. Its coastline is full of islands, inlets, beaches, and very beautiful natural treasures, all which make it an excellent tourist destination. There is a multitude of attractions based around the beaches, as well as protected areas, both land based and around its islands. The area’s center is located at Puntarenas which acts as a place for lodging, distribution, port of call, and excursions. Within its tourism locales you can find a variety of hotels and traditional cabins close to the ocean as well as all-inclusive lodging facilities.

This spectacular area is very close to the Central Valley, around two hours by car and 74 miles from the capital.

The peninsula area has very important areas geared toward tourism like, Tambor, Santa Teresa, and Montezuma, all with very beautiful natural areas, specifically its beach areas. You can also find the Cabo Blanco Absolute Nature Reserve, San Lucas, Chira, Tortuga, and Coco Islands.

The Monteverde area, located north of Puntarenas, has both national and international significance because of its conservation efforts and life style centered around nature. Santa Elena is the hub for commercial services and tourism-based businesses. Other important communities are San Luis and Gerardo.

The primary attraction is the Monteverde Biological Reserve, however there are many other nature sites, picturesque trails, hanging bridges, as well as butterfly and frog exhibits.

 <h3>Important aspects of the Costa Rican climate </h3>   
<p>
The Pacific region is characterized by a well-defined dry and rainy season.The dry season lasts from December to March. April is a transition month. The driest and hottest month is March.The Pacific region begins in the northwest and ends in the southeast, meaning that the dividing line changes from north to south.

The rainy season goes from May to October, with November being a month of transition.There is a relative decrease in the amount of rain during the months of July and August, which are termed veranillo, or “little summer”.These months are marked by an intensification of the trade winds.The rainiest month are September and October, mainly due to the influence of the cyclone systems, the monsoon winds from the equatorial Pacific Ocean, and the sea breezes.
The rains mainly occur during the afternoon and early evening.

Caribbean
The climate regime of this side of the country does not have a well-defined dry season, since the rains remain steady between 100 and 200 mm in the driest months, which is a considerable amount.

Two relatively dry periods exist in the coastal zones. The first dry period is between February and March and the second between September and October.

The first dry period is in sync with the Pacific dry season, while the second period occurs during the rainiest months on the west coast.In addition, there are two rainy periods between the dry ones. The first one goes from November to January and is the strongest rainy period.

 The second one stretches from May to August and is characterized by a maximum in July that coincides with the “little summer” in the Pacific.The rainiest month is December, which is influenced by the effects of cold fronts coming from the Northern Hemisphere, which are present between November and May, though their greatest effect is felt between November and March. Rain falls mostly during the night and morning. </p>

<h2>Costa Rica's Greatest Wildlife Spectacles - On Land </h2> <!--Add the last piece of information about your place here-->
    <p>
There are few natural spectacles more impressive than the massive arrival of sea turtles. At night, turtles will gather near the coast in preparation for their departure from the water to come ashore in an extraordinary effort to lay their eggs and thus ensure the next generation. They return to the same beach where they nested before, guided through the vast ocean by instincts and skills difficult to understand. These arrivals detonate other natural cycles that cascade through the ecosystem, taking advantage of this majestic natural happening. Predators, from rodents, raccoons and coatis, as well as coyotes, jaguars and even humans come to the nesting beaches for their part of the bounty. The turtles themselves dig up eggs of neighboring nests from lack of space. Despite the feast, thousands of hatchlings are born to refresh the populations of these species.

<img src="baby.webp" alt="baby animals"> events such as the first storms of the rainy season ignite large concerts of frogs and toads, frantically looking for their partners to take advantage of each pool, each wetland and every puddle to deposit the next generation. Some wear bright, elegant colors for courtship, while others take advantage of the great reproductive distraction to catch a meal or two. As with turtles, the survival strategy is the massive event. Hundreds of thousands of eggs or tadpoles can feed a variety of animals, snakes, fish, and even peccaries and birds, still leaving many more to</p>
