The Puntarenas tourist area and the Golfo Islands comprise 1517 sq. miles and 264 miles of coast line. Part of the area’s boundaries is undefined since a part of the Nicoya Peninsula, as well as the city of Puntarenas, fall within this area. The shoreline of both tourism areas is joined by maritime transport. The area extends from Punta Conejo south to Puerto caldera where the mouth of the Bongo River is located.

Puntarenas is one of the most important tourism regions in Costa Rica. Its coastline is full of islands, inlets, beaches, and very beautiful natural treasures, all which make it an excellent tourist destination. There is a multitude of attractions based around the beaches, as well as protected areas, both land based and around its islands. The area’s center is located at Puntarenas which acts as a place for lodging, distribution, port of call, and excursions. Within its tourism locales you can find a variety of hotels and traditional cabins close to the ocean as well as all-inclusive lodging facilities.

This spectacular area is very close to the Central Valley, around two hours by car and 74 miles from the capital.

The peninsula area has very important areas geared toward tourism like, Tambor, Santa Teresa, and Montezuma, all with very beautiful natural areas, specifically its beach areas. You can also find the Cabo Blanco Absolute Nature Reserve, San Lucas, Chira, Tortuga, and Coco Islands.

The Monteverde area, located north of Puntarenas, has both national and international significance because of its conservation efforts and life style centered around nature. Santa Elena is the hub for commercial services and tourism-based businesses. Other important communities are San Luis and Gerardo.

The primary attraction is the Monteverde Biological Reserve, however there are many other nature sites, picturesque trails, hanging bridges, as well as butterfly and frog exhibits.

<h2>Costa Rica's Greatest Wildlife Spectacles - On Land </h2> <!--Add the last piece of information about your place here-->

There are few natural spectacles more impressive than the massive arrival of sea turtles. At night, turtles will gather near the coast in preparation for their departure from the water to come ashore in an extraordinary effort to lay their eggs and thus ensure the next generation. They return to the same beach where they nested before, guided through the vast ocean by instincts and skills difficult to understand. These arrivals detonate other natural cycles that cascade through the ecosystem, taking advantage of this majestic natural happening. Predators, from rodents, raccoons and coatis, as well as coyotes, jaguars and even humans come to the nesting beaches for their part of the bounty. The turtles themselves dig up eggs of neighboring nests from lack of space. Despite the feast, thousands of hatchlings are born to refresh the populations of these species.

 Events such as the first storms of the rainy season ignite large concerts of frogs and toads, frantically looking for their partners to take advantage of each pool, each wetland and every puddle to deposit the next generation. Some wear bright, elegant colors for courtship, while others take advantage of the great reproductive distraction to catch a meal or two. As with turtles, the survival strategy is the massive event. Hundreds of thousands of eggs or tadpoles can feed a variety of animals, snakes, fish, and even peccaries and birds, still leaving many more to</p>
